### A free, lightweight, open-source tool designed to simplify API discovery and change tracking:
### "Update your knowledge base with the latest API docs"

---

> ⚠️ **Under Construction**  
> This project is in the early stages of development and may not function as intended yet. Contributions, feedback, and ideas are highly welcome!

---

### 🚀 Key Features (Planned for MVP)  
- 🔍 **Search & Browse:** Easily find APIs by keyword or category.  (e.g., "Machine Learning APIs," "Finance APIs")  
- 📄 **Latest API Metadata Retrieval:** Retrieve up-to-date API endpoints and parameters, directly from official documentation.  
- 📂 **Export API Data:** Download JSON or YAML files for use in tools like Swagger Editor, Postman, or CI pipelines.  
- 📢 **Change Tracking:** Stay ahead of API updates with notifications about changes, deprecated endpoints, or new features—delivered via email, Discord, webhooks, or RSS feeds.  
- 🛠 **VS Code Integration:** Use the lightweight UpdAPI extension to search and retrieve APIs directly from your terminal.  

### Why Choose UpdAPI?  
UpdAPI is built for **API discovery and integration, specifically with LLMs**. It’s the fastest way to centralize API knowledge, making it easier to build and maintain software with up-to-date API versions.
